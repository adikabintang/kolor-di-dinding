## How a switch learn MAC addresses:

```
H1 ---eth0 S eth1--- H2
          eth 2 
           |
           |
           H3
```

When H1 wants to send data to H2, and it goes to eth0 of switch S, S knows that eth0 is connected to MAC H1. The, it puts H1 MAC address and the interface eth0 to the MAC routing table. Because it does not know MAC address of H2, it floods the traffict to H3 and H2 (not to H1). When H2 replies, it saves the H2 mac address and the network interface the switch S connects to into the MAC routing table.

VLAN is creating a virtual LAN within LAN. The goal is to make virtually isolated LAN networks within LAN.

## Spanning Tree Protocol

Consider this loop scenario on layer 2:

```
     R2
    /  \
H--R1---R3
```

Host H sends ARP request with MAC broadcast address as its destination (or like the above section on "How a switch learn MAC addresses" which will flood the switch interface). R1 sends to R2 and R3. R2 sends to R3. R3 sends to R2 (the packet coming from R1). Rr sends to R1 (coming from R2). And so on and so on. Loop infinitely.

Spanning tree protocol creates a spanning tree to make a subgraph that contains no loop. Spanning tree is a subgraph that takes all vertices with minimal edges, hence creating a loop-free subgraph.

Basically what it does is blocking one of the interfaces of the switches to stop the loop. But the detail is more than that.
