## How a switch learn MAC addresses:

```
H1 ---eth0 S eth1--- H2
          eth 2 
           |
           |
           H3
```

When H1 wants to send data to H2, and it goes to eth0 of switch S, S knows that eth0 is connected to MAC H1. Then, it puts H1 MAC address and the interface eth0 to the MAC routing table. Because it does not know MAC address of H2, it floods the traffict to H3 and H2 (not to H1). When H2 replies, it saves the H2 mac address and the network interface the switch S connects to into the MAC routing table.

## Spanning Tree Protocol

Consider this loop scenario on layer 2:

```
     R2
    /  \
H--R1---R3
```

Host H sends ARP request with MAC broadcast address as its destination (or like the above section on "How a switch learn MAC addresses" which will flood the switch interface). R1 sends to R2 and R3. R2 sends to R3. R3 sends to R2 (the packet coming from R1). R3 sends to R1 (coming from R2). And so on and so on. Loop infinitely.

Spanning tree protocol creates a spanning tree to make a subgraph that contains no loop. Spanning tree is a subgraph that takes all vertices with minimal edges, hence creating a loop-free subgraph.

Basically what it does is blocking one of the interfaces of the switches to stop the loop. But the detail is more than that.

Steps:

1. Elect a Root Bridge, and set the interfaces of the _Root Bridge_ into a "Forwarding" (FWD) state
2. Each non-root switch selects its _Root Port_: the best interface/port to the Root Bridge
3. Remaining links choose a _Designated Port_
4. All other ports are put in to a Blocking State

Roles of the ports:

1. Root ports: the best ports to reach thte Root Bridge
2. Designated Port: port with the best route to the Root Bridge on a link
3. Non-Designated Port: All other port that is in a blocking state

States of the port:

1. Disabled
2. Blocking
3. Listening: Only listen, not forwarding traffic and not learning MAC address
4. Learning: Not forwarding traffic but learning MAC address
5. Forwarding: sending and receiving traffic like normal

Listening and Learning states are transitional states.

STP encapsulates the message in Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU).

Re-visiting the steps:

1. How to elect the root bridge: every switche broadcasts BID. The one with the lowest BID is the Root Bridge.
2. How to select the Root Port: based on cost (like OSPF). The faster the link, the lowest the cost. Then, do some cost calculation.
3. How to select designated port:
4. How to select non-designated port:

# Security issues with ARP

- https://moodle.epfl.ch/pluginfile.php/2710119/mod_resource/content/2/ip1.pdf
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing

ARP spoofing: attacker aims to associate its MAC address to the IP of the target, like the gateway, so that the traffic will flow through the attacker.

Mitigation:

- DHCP snooping: switch/wifi base station observes all DHCP traffic and remembers the mapping IP addr-MAC
- dynamic ARP inspection: switch filters all ARP and allows only valid answers
